Don't want the entire solution?

I found this link:
https://download-directory.github.io/

Take the link of the folder (https://github.com/GraphicsProgramming/learnd3d11/tree/main/src/Cpp/1-getting-started/1-1-0-Empty)
and drop it in there for a quick DL.

Found from:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106012/download-a-single-folder-or-directory-from-a-github-repo

Use 7 Zip to "Extract Files..." and make a subfolder. Contents are no placed in a subfolder & will spill where the folder is if you "Extract here"
