1. Download the entire solution. (trust me)
2. Open the .sln file in the /src folder.
3. Right click the project in your solution explorer that you want to use. NOT the entire solution. Pick one project.
4. Select properties. 
5. Go to Configuration Properties -> General
6. Set "Windows SDK Version" to a version you have. Mine is "10.0.17763.0"
7. Set Platform Toolset. Mine is "Visual Studio 20178 (v141)







Don't want the entire solution? 
Sorry, but the configuration is in the SLN and depends on other files in the repository.
